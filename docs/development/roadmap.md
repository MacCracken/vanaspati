# Vanaspati Roadmap

> **Vanaspati** (Sanskrit: lord of the forest, plant/tree) — botany and plant behavior engine for growth, photosynthesis, seasonal cycles, and ecosystems.

## Scope

Vanaspati owns the **science of plants**: growth models, photosynthesis, seasonal cycles, root systems, pollination, seed dispersal, and ecosystem dynamics. It provides the math; consumers decide what to do with it (render forests, simulate ecosystems, model agriculture).

Vanaspati does NOT own:
- **Math primitives** -> hisab (vectors, geometry, calculus)
- **Rendering** -> soorat/kiran (they consume vanaspati for vegetation visualization)
- **Animal behavior** -> jantu (animals interact with plants via bridges)
- **Weather/climate** -> badal (weather drives plant growth via bridges)
- **Sound synthesis** -> garjan (foliage rustling via garjan's bridge)

## Backlog

> Not scheduled — demand-gated.

### High Priority

- [x] **Water/soil moisture system** — precipitation, soil water storage, root uptake, drought stress on growth/photosynthesis. Single biggest missing piece — water is the primary limiting factor for plant growth in most terrestrial ecosystems
- [x] **Nutrient system (nitrogen)** — soil N pool, uptake, effect on growth rate. Nitrogen is the most commonly limiting nutrient
### Medium Priority

- [ ] Mycorrhizal network (plant-fungal nutrient exchange)
- [ ] Allelopathy (chemical competition between plants)
- [ ] Fire ecology (fire-adapted species, post-fire regeneration)
- [x] **Herbivory pressure** — grazing/browsing biomass removal
- [x] **Vegetative reproduction** — runners, rhizomes, root sprouting (clonal spread)
- [x] **Succession dynamics** — pioneer vs. climax species, shade tolerance, lifespan classes
- [ ] Remaining mortality types — fire, disease, windthrow
